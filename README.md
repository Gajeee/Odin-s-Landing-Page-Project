## <span style="color:#8b0000;">About</span>

This project was created as part of  
**The Odin Project — Landing Page assignment**.

The objective was to build a complete webpage from scratch using  
**HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript**, focusing on layout, structure, and visual hierarchy.

Rather than a generic business theme, this implementation explores a  
<span style="color:#8b0000;"><strong>gothic psychological horror aesthetic</strong></span>,  
drawing inspiration from the mood, isolation, and memory-based tension of  
**_Goth (2003)_**.

## <span style="color:#8b0000;">Tech</span>

CSS  
JavaScript  

No frameworks.  
No libraries.  
Just foundations.
